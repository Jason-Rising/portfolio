        "overview": "Anxiety: Revelation of Mind is a survival horror game set during World War I. This project marked my first venture into both game development and programming. Developing this game was an incredibly rewarding experience and played a pivotal role in inspiring me to pursue a career in software development after high school.\n\nThe game was built using the Unity engine and took over a year (2015â€“2016) to complete. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into .NET architecture and object-oriented design patterns. Additionally, I worked on key game development components, such as character controllers, rigid body physics, state-machine and behaviour tree AI architecture, and file systems for saving mechanics.\n\nThe game was released on Itch.io in 2016, where it achieved moderate success and was featured by several YouTubers.",
